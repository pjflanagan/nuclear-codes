Client
- [ ] no errors within elements, all errors are globally set DO THIS FIRST
- [ ] make mobile ready so people can play on phone (IMPORTANT)

Server
- [ ] alert error route, use this (a good place to start is sign on, but after that do room assignments)
- [ ] a auto tester that responds automatically, also drops and re-adds players randomly
- [ ] send timer route, it triggers a global timer that when not met advances with default data
- [ ] remove env from git and add a password to the server test

Both
- [ ] make the gameRules.json file be the source of truth for Server and Client?
