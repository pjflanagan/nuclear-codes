# NEW GAME RULES IDEAS

- Spies see both letters
- Agents only see true letter

This way the spy can choose to lie, and accuse the agent of being a spy, this will make it more a who is who kind of game, rather than a which is which. By the end of the game, the agents should know who to trust so that way they send one agent into each room.

- The code changes every round
  - could be too hard for agents (needs rooms=agents for this to work)
  - if we do it this way, say which percentage was correct:

Determine code logic:
  - select the most voted for code amongst agents
  - return the code that was voted for and what percent it was correct
